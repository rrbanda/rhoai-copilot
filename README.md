RHOAI Copilot is an AI agent that manages the full lifecycle of **Red Hat OpenShift AI** through 5 MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It handles everything from initial platform deployment through day-2 operations, model serving, and safety governance — all via GitOps. Built for both connected and **disconnected (air-gapped)** environments.

---

## Get Started in 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/rrbanda/rhoai-copilot.git && cd rhoai-copilot
oc create secret generic rhoai-copilot-secrets -n rhoai-copilot \
  --from-literal=gemini-api-key=YOUR_KEY \
  --from-literal=argocd-api-token=YOUR_TOKEN \
  --from-literal=dashboard-password=YOUR_PASSWORD

# 2. Deploy (or use pre-built image: ghcr.io/rrbanda/rhoai-copilot:latest)
make deploy

# 3. Validate
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh
```

> [!TIP]
> See the [Full Deployment Guide](docs/getting-started/deployment-guide.md) for the complete walkthrough with all 5 MCP servers, or [Disconnected Agent Setup](docs/guides/disconnected-setup.md) for deploying the agent on air-gapped clusters.

> [!NOTE]
> **Want to deploy RHOAI itself?** Once the agent is running, ask it: _"Deploy RHOAI on my disconnected cluster"_ or _"Deploy RHOAI 3.5 on my connected cluster."_ The agent has battle-tested deployment skills for both connected and air-gapped environments. See the [deployment templates](manifests/disconnected/) for the underlying manifests.

## Why RHOAI Copilot

- **42 skills across 9 lifecycle phases** — from platform setup through model safety, covering the entire RHOAI 3.5 surface
- **5 MCP server integrations** — ArgoCD, RHOAI, OpenShift, MLflow, and GitHub in a unified interface
- **GitOps-native** — all configuration changes flow through Git PRs, never direct cluster mutations
- **3-tier safety model** — read-only by default, confirmed writes for Tier 2, pre-approved scope for autonomous ops
- **Disconnected-first** — air-gapped environments are a primary design constraint, not an afterthought
- **44 eval scenarios** — 100% skill coverage with adversarial safety tests, automated runner, and CI integration

## What It Looks Like

```
You:    Deploy RHOAI 2.19 on my disconnected cluster.
        Internal registry is registry.lab.internal:5000.

Agent:  I'll guide you through the full disconnected deployment.

        1. First, let me check your current cluster state...
           [calls: list_applications, cluster_summary]

        2. Here's your ImageSetConfiguration for oc-mirror:
           [generates YAML for registry.lab.internal:5000]

        3. After mirroring, apply this Kustomize overlay:
           [generates disconnected overlay patches]

        Shall I create a PR with these changes to your GitOps repo?
```

## Lifecycle Coverage

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/lifecycle-coverage.png" alt="Lifecycle Coverage" width="720">
</p>

| Phase | Count | Skills |
|-------|:-----:|--------|
| **Platform Setup** | 5 | Connected + disconnected deploy (CLI/Console/GitOps), install validator, GitOps config generator |
| **Plan** | 4 | Capacity forecaster, serving runtime advisor, training planner, model catalog |
| **Administer** | 6 | DSC inspector, platform status, upgrades, Kueue quotas, hardware profiles, Feature Store |
| **Develop** | 7 | Workbenches, pipelines, experiments, model registry, OGX/RAG, AutoRAG, GenAI Playground |
| **Train** | 2 | Distributed training (Ray/PyTorch), AutoML |
| **Evaluate** | 1 | LM-Eval benchmarks via EvalHub |
| **Deploy** | 8 | MaaS, llm-d, KServe, model promotion, subscriptions, external models |
| **Monitor** | 6 | ArgoCD health, drift, daily reports, incidents, MaaS debug, model drift |
| **Maintain Safety** | 2 | NeMo Guardrails, Garak vulnerability scanning |

---

## MCP Servers

The agent connects to external systems through 5 Model Context Protocol servers:

| Server | Transport | What It Provides |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **ArgoCD** | stdio | GitOps lifecycle — sync, health, drift, resource trees |
| **RHOAI** | HTTP | AI platform ops — projects, models, workbenches, pipelines, training |
| **OpenShift** | HTTP | Cluster operations — pods, nodes, events, namespaces |
| **MLflow** | HTTP | Experiment tracking — runs, metrics, model registry |
| **GitHub** | stdio | Git operations — PRs, branches, file content |

---

## Safety Model

The agent operates under a strict 3-tier autonomy model defined in [`agent/rules.md`](agent/rules.md):

| Tier | Mode | Examples | Confirmation |
|:----:|------|---------|:------------:|
| 1 | Read-Only | Health checks, reports, diagnostics | None |
| 2 | Controlled Writes | ArgoCD sync (dry-run first), workbench creation, PRs | Required |
| 3 | Autonomous | Scheduled health reports, drift alerts | Pre-approved |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hard constraints (never violated):** No deletes. No writes in `redhat-ods-*` or `openshift-*` namespaces. No direct cluster mutations (GitOps only). No credential exposure. No self-approval of Tier 2 operations.

---

## Built for 5 Personas

| Persona | Focus | Top Skills |

| LLM Provider | Gemini API | Local vLLM / Ollama |
| Image Sources | Public registries | Internal mirror |
| Deploy | `oc apply -k .` | `oc apply -k runtimes/hermes/overlays/disconnected/` |
